# Creative Lab: Unique Expansion Plan (Course Correction)

The user explicitly requested unique, custom-built experiments and rejected the previous "copy-paste" batch. We will implement 3 high-quality, physically interactive experiments to start, ensuring they are not just reused UI components.

## Goals
1.  **Remove** low-effort experiments (Completed).
2.  **Add** "Creative Lab" CTA to the Homepage for better discoverability.
3.  **Build 3 UNIQUE** Experiments (07, 08, 09).

## Proposed Unique Experiments

### Experiment 07: Quantum Field (Interactive Flow)
-   **Concept**: A visualizer of thousands of particles that follow a flow field. Interacting with the mouse disturbs the field like dragging a hand through water.
-   **Visuals**: Glowing particles, fluid motion, trail effects.
-   **Tech**: HTML5 Canvas API (custom logic), no external heavy libraries if possible, or simple R3F points. *Decision: Canvas API for raw performance and "matrix" feel.*
-   **Interaction**: Mouse move creates turbulence. Click bursts particles.

### Experiment 08: Gravity Well (Physics)
-   **Concept**: A minimal N-body simulation. You click to place "stars" (gravity wells) and smaller asteroids orbit them.
-   **Visuals**: Minimalist stark black/white (or neon). Trajectories drawn in real-time.
-   **Tech**: Custom Physics Engine (JavaScript) + Canvas.
-   **Interaction**: Click & Drag to shoot asteroids. Right-click to spawn Black Hole (Gravity Well).

### Experiment 09: Audio Visualizer (Custom)
-   **Concept**: A realtime audio frequency visualizer. Since we can't easily capture system audio without permission, we will create a "Synthesizer" mode where the visualizer reacts to notes generated by the user (similar to Tone Matrix but visually distinct - maybe circular or waveform based).
-   **Visuals**: Circular frequency bars or 3D terrain reacting to bass.
-   **Tech**: Web Audio API + R3F.

## Homepage Integration
-   **Location**: Below "Approach" section.
-   **Component**: `CreativeLabCTA.tsx`.
-   **Design**: A distinct, possibly "glitchy" or "holographic" card that invites the user to "Enter the Lab".

## Verification
-   Verify all previous experiments (01-06) still work.
-   Verify Homepage CTA links to `/lab`.
-   Verify Exps 07-09 are unique and interactive.
